# Blog-posts
It a microservice app. I made service for every resource in the app. So, I have two main services: posts and comments. For posts, I have two other services: CreatePosts and ListPosts and for comments too. For every change that happened in one of our services, those services sent an event to event-bus (another service) and event-bus notice other services for changes. In my app services are not dependent on each-others. If one of my services is down for some reason, others are working correctly.
